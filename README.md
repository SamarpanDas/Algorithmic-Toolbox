This is my personal notes belonging to the Algorithmic Toolbox course that I am currently doing in Coursera.
The solutions will be added as a solve the problems.

These notes are being made public to help begineer and amateur programmers in their process of improvement of their skills.
These are aboslutely high quality contents and I am sure that one who goes through these notes will surely will be able to enhance their skills.

I am making the questions available too and expect readers to try to solve the problems without looking at my solutions.

These materials will be updated often.
